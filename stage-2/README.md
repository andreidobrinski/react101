# React 101

## Stage 2 - Our first component

We have now added a simple message indicating how much time is left until some date in the future. This element is contained in `components/CountdownClock.js`.

Spend some time looking at `CountdownClock`'s code, especially the comments that have been included in `components/CountdownClock.js` and in `App.js`.

## Stage 1 - Hello, World and Cleanup

Currently, the project is mostly empty. A simple `h1` and `p` tag are the only elements present on this single page app.

The entrypoint of the project is `src/index.js`. `create-react-app` bundles and inserts a `script` tag inside `public/index.html` during the build step, so you don't have to worry about manually linking to your script.

In Stage 2, we will add a new component: `CountdownClock`.
