# React 101

# Getting Started

## Install Node

Make sure you have Node.js installed. One easy way to install it is to download it from [the official Node site][https://nodejs.org]

Check what you get when you run `node --version`. If your node version is `8.x.x` or higher, you're good!

## Run a stage

After you have done this, you can go to each `stage-*` folder and run the following commands to get the project going.

```
# First, enter the stage you'd like to start.
cd stage-0

# This command is used to install dependencies. You only have to run this once.
npm install

# This command is used to start the stage's server. 
# You can press CTRL+C to stop the server.
npm start
```
