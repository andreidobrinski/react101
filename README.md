# React 101

# How to use this project

This project is intended to be used during the Workhaus Academy React 101 class. The class is sectioned into stages 0 through 7, which is reflected in the folder structure of this project. Each Each stage represents a step in the evolution of a simple React application. Along the way, you'll learn how to use various React concepts to build a single-page application.

As you follow along, `cd` into each stage and take a look at the project structure. Watch and observe how it evolves, and feel free to ask any questions you may have at any time.

# Getting Started

## Install Node

Make sure you have Node.js installed. One easy way to install it is to download it from [the official Node site](https://nodejs.org)

Check what you get when you run `node --version`. If your node version is `8.x.x` or higher, you're good!

## Install Yarn (Recommended, but optional) 

This step is entirely optional, but recommended. 

Yarn will make the installation step very fast -- otherwise, you might be waiting more than 30 seconds for installation to finish. Yarn accomplishes this by using a combination of multithreading and local caching of dependencies.

To install Yarn, see the instructions on [the official Yarn site](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install)

## Running a stage

After you have done this, you can go to each `stage-*` folder and run the following commands to get the project going.

### Using Yarn

```
# First, enter the stage you'd like to start.
cd stage-0

# This command is used to install dependencies. You only have to run this once.
yarn install

# This command is used to start the stage's server. 
# You can press CTRL+C to stop the server.
yarn start
```


### Not Using Yarn

```
# First, enter the stage you'd like to start.
cd stage-0

# This command is used to install dependencies. You only have to run this once.
