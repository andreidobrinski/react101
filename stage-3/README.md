# React 101 - Stage 3 - Passing Parameters

One of React's strengths is the ability to parcel and reuse the same code in multiple places. In this stage, we're going to pass "props" to CountdownClock so we can configure the date we're counting down to.

What does 'CountdownClock''s `render()` method do now? How are we passing properties into CountdownClock?

If you wanted to render a second clock that counted down to New Year's 2019, how would you do so?

The next step makes the clock update automatically, like a real countdown timer should.
