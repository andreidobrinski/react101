# React 101 - Stage 1

Now, we've taken the default `create-react-app` project and cleaned it up a bit. Currently, the project is mostly empty. A simple `h1` and `p` tag are the only elements present on this single page app.

The entrypoint of the project is `src/index.js`. `create-react-app` bundles and inserts a `script` tag inside `public/index.html` during the build step, so you don't have to worry about manually linking to your script.

In Stage 2, we will add a new component: `CountdownClock`.
