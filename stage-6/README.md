# React 101 - Stage 6 - State

What if we wanted to support multiple timers, and not just one for New Year's? And what if we wanted to switch between timers using a dropdown?

In this stage, we'll teach our code to change the target date based on a simple code change. This will lead into the next stage, where we'll apply the same change using a dropdown, in real time.

Look at `App.js` now. What do you see? What has changed? Where is the date being stored now, and how is it being retrieved before being passed into CountdownClock?
